## Introduction
Welcome to our final-project for Advanced Programming(AP) class. in this project we had to simulate YouTube using java programming. The application aims to mimic the core functionalities of YouTube, including video uploading, viewing, and user interactions like commenting and liking. to designing UI, we used many Apps such as figma, adobe photoShop and sceneBuilder. for coding, we use IntelliJ IDEA and VsCode.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Commenting and liking on videos
- Video search functionality
- User profiles
- Video upload and streaming
- Video play manager
- Hiding videos
- searching channels


## Technologies Used
- Java: The main programming language used for backend development.
- JavaFX: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- SQL: Database to store user information, videos, comments, etc.
- Maven: Build automation tools.
- IntelliJ IDEA: The ide to coding.
- SceneBuilder: A drag and drop App to design pages.
- Adobe PhotoShop/Figma: for designing icon and buttons.
- VsCode: Writing Readme file
